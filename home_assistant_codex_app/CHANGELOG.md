# Changelog

All notable changes to HA Codex are documented here.

## 1.2.20

- Added support for the `aarch64` architecture, so HA Codex now installs on 64-bit Arm hosts such as the Raspberry Pi 4 and 5, Home Assistant Green, Home Assistant Yellow, and ODROID-N2+. Codex CLI, `codex-code-mode-host`, ttyd, and trzsz are downloaded as their native Arm builds.
- Every release is now built and smoke-tested on both amd64 and aarch64 before it is published. Model choices and settings are unchanged.

## 1.2.19

- Updated the pinned Codex CLI from 0.157.0 to 0.157.1, including the version-matched `codex-code-mode-host` artifact. See the [Codex 0.157.1 release notes](https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/tag/rust-v0.157.1) for what changed.
- Released automatically after the amd64 build and smoke test passed. Model choices and settings are unchanged.

## 1.2.18

- Updated the pinned Codex CLI from 0.156.1 to 0.157.0, including the version-matched `codex-code-mode-host` artifact. See the [Codex 0.157.0 release notes](https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/tag/rust-v0.157.0) for what changed.
- Released automatically after the amd64 build and smoke test passed. Model choices and settings are unchanged.

## 1.2.17

- Added `max` and `ultra` to the **Reasoning effort** option. `ultra` is available on GPT-6 Astra, GPT-6 Sol, GPT-5.6 Terra, and GPT-5.6 Sol, and `max` on those models plus GPT-6 Luna and GPT-5.6 Luna, matching Codex's model catalog. If the selected model does not offer the chosen level, HA Codex starts the session with the model's highest level instead (for example `xhigh` for GPT-5.5) and says so in the add-on log. The default stays `xhigh`, and existing installs keep their saved choice.

## 1.2.16

- Updated the pinned Codex CLI from 0.156.0 to 0.156.1, including the version-matched `codex-code-mode-host` artifact. This release adds GPT-6 Sol and Luna to Codex's built-in model list, including `xhigh` reasoning for GPT-6 Luna.
- Changed the default model from `gpt-5.6-terra` to `gpt-6-luna`. This only applies to new installs; existing installs keep the model already saved in their Configuration tab.
- Added a **Reasoning effort** option (`default`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`), defaulting to `xhigh`. Any value other than `default` starts new Codex sessions with that `model_reasoning_effort`; `default` leaves the model's own setting, or the one saved in Codex, in place.

## 1.2.15

- Added a **Skip command approvals** ("YOLO mode") option, off by default. When on, new Codex sessions start with `--ask-for-approval never`, so the choice survives add-on restarts instead of resetting like `/approvals` does. When off, nothing changes and any `approval_policy` in Codex's `config.toml` still applies.

## 1.2.14

- Added a **Codex memories** option to the add-on Configuration tab. When on, new Codex sessions start with the Codex `memories` feature enabled. It is off by default, and when off, any choice made with `/memories` in Codex still applies.
- Fixed the startup warning "`[features].memory_tool` is deprecated". At startup the add-on now renames the old `memory_tool` key to `memories` in the saved Codex `config.toml`, keeping its value, and changes nothing else in the file.

## 1.2.13

- Updated the pinned Codex CLI from 0.154.0 to 0.156.0, including the version-matched `codex-code-mode-host` artifact.
- Added `gpt-6-sol` and `gpt-6-luna` alongside `gpt-6-astra` in the model selector. Availability depends on the account, sign-in method, workspace settings, and rollout; adding a choice does not grant model access.
- Kept `gpt-5.6-terra` as the default and preserved existing model choices and saved settings.
- Updated the model documentation to match the selector and note that GPT-5.5 retires from Codex with ChatGPT sign-in on October 14, 2026; its API availability is unchanged.
- Picked up upstream fixes for streamed responses, tmux clipboard forwarding, session resumption, and login through system proxies.

## 1.2.12

- Enabled Option+drag text selection in the browser terminal on macOS (`macOptionClickForcesSelection`), so Mac users can copy terminal text to the clipboard while tmux owns the mouse, matching the existing Shift+drag behavior on Windows and Linux.
- Documented how to copy and paste inside the terminal on Windows and macOS, including why Ctrl+C interrupts Codex instead of copying and why plain Ctrl+V does not paste.

## 1.2.11

- Updated the pinned Codex CLI from 0.153.4 to 0.154.0, including the version-matched `codex-code-mode-host` artifact.
- Picked up Codex's inline questions, so a question can be answered while Codex keeps working without losing an in-progress draft, plus Vim replace mode with undo and improved Escape handling in the terminal editor.
- Picked up Codex fixes for plugin tool refresh, MCP OAuth coordination, workspace trust verification, permission preservation when resuming or forking a session, and conversation resumption conflicts.
- Note: Codex removed the `codex mcp-server` command in this release. HA Codex never invoked it, so add-on behavior is unchanged, but any personal script that called it needs updating.
- `gpt-5.6-terra` remains the HA Codex default and the model selector is unchanged.

## 1.2.10

- Updated the pinned Codex CLI from 0.152.0 to 0.153.4, including the version-matched `codex-code-mode-host` artifact.
- Included Codex's Astra model-picker visibility fix and updated Astra tool guidance while keeping `gpt-5.6-terra` as the HA Codex default.
- Updated amd64 validation to read its image base and dependency versions directly from `build.yaml`, preventing the test workflow from drifting from the release pin.

## 1.2.9

- Added `gpt-6-astra` to the model selector. Availability depends on the user's ChatGPT plan, workspace settings, and rollout eligibility.
- Removed `gpt-5.4` and `gpt-5.4-mini` from the selector because they retired from Codex with ChatGPT sign-in; use `gpt-5.6-terra` and `gpt-5.6-luna` respectively.
- Kept `gpt-5.6-terra` as the default model for broad compatibility.

## 1.2.8

- Included the version-matched `codex-code-mode-host`, fixing local workspace and image-inspection tools that failed because the host executable was absent.
- Added Node.js so Node-based plugin MCP servers, including `dataAnalyticsWidgets`, can start. npm is not installed because these servers use the bundled runtime files directly.
- Cloudflare MCP authentication remains a separate, optional, user-configured action; HA Codex does not authenticate it automatically.

## 1.2.7

- Added a latest-release version badge to the READMEs and linked the changelog from both. Documentation only; no functional changes.

## 1.2.6

- Updated the add-on base image from Alpine 3.22 to 3.23.
- Pinned Codex to a specific release (0.152.0) instead of always installing the latest, so a future Codex change cannot silently alter the add-on's behavior. Bump `CODEX_VERSION` in `build.yaml` to update Codex.

## 1.2.5

- Fixed pasting long text, which 1.2.4 broke by enabling trzsz: its browser client routes terminal input through a paste/drag handler that mangles large pastes.
- Made terminal file transfer an opt-in **Terminal file transfer** setting, off by default, so pasting works normally out of the box.
- When the setting is on, `trz`/`tsz`, the Ctrl-b u shortcut, drag-and-drop, and the start-up hint work as before; when off, none of the transfer client options are enabled.

## 1.2.4

- Enabled ttyd's `trzsz`/zmodem browser file transfer (`enableTrzsz`/`enableZmodem`), which 1.2.3 shipped the binaries for but never turned on — so `trz`/`tsz` now actually open a browser file picker instead of hanging.
- Added a one-key attach shortcut: press Ctrl-b then u to open an upload picker and drop the file into `/homeassistant` without leaving Codex.
- Enabled drag-and-drop upload onto a shell prompt, and added a start-up hint showing how to attach and download files.
- Documented that transfers run from a shell (not the Codex prompt) and that some browsers require HTTPS for the file picker.

## 1.2.3

- Added terminal file transfer: run `trz` to attach (upload) a file from your device into the workspace, and `tsz <file>` to download one, using the terminal's built-in `trzsz` support and a browser file picker.
- Bundled the `trzsz` binaries in the add-on image and documented the attach/download workflow in the README.

## 1.2.2

- Clarified that Patch compatibility mode's full-access sandbox is applied when a Codex session starts, so a persistent session that began before the mode was enabled (or one changed with `/approvals`) can still hit the `bwrap: Failed to make / slave: Permission denied` error until the add-on is restarted.
- Added start-up logging that states the effective Codex sandbox mode and reminds you to restart the add-on after changing it.
- Documented how to recover a session stuck in `workspace-write`: choose Full Access in `/approvals`, or restart the add-on with Patch compatibility mode enabled.
- Started new sessions with Codex's `--sandbox danger-full-access` flag for the full-access patch path.

## 1.2.1

- Removed browser-callback sign-in, which cannot reliably return to an isolated Home Assistant add-on container from a user's browser at `localhost`.
- Made Device Code the first, preferred sign-in option and renumbered API-key sign-in as option 2.
- Preserved the working persistent-session terminal history rail, including its mouse-wheel, click, drag, and arrow controls.

## 1.2.0

- Rebuilt the terminal history rail injection to avoid `sed` replacement corruption that prevented prior rails from working and caused layout artifacts.
- The side rail now stays visible and supports arrows, clicking its track, and dragging its thumb, while retaining persistent sessions and mouse-wheel scrolling.

## 1.1.9

- Removed the malformed interactive history-rail fallback that could obscure the terminal with a large banner. Mouse-wheel and trackpad scrolling remain available.

## 1.1.8

- Made the always-visible history rail interactive: click or drag its track, or use its arrows, to navigate terminal scrollback in addition to mouse-wheel and trackpad scrolling.

## 1.1.7

- Added a CSS-rendered, always-visible history indicator for embedded browsers that defer the terminal page's injected rail script.

## 1.1.6

- Added an always-visible history rail for persistent tmux sessions, including arrow controls and a draggable track that use the same working wheel-navigation path.

## 1.1.5

- Loads tmux's mouse and alternate-screen settings before its server starts, preserving the browser's xterm scrollback and visible scrollbar for persistent sessions.

## 1.1.4

- Restored tmux mouse/copy-mode scrolling for persistent sessions, so mouse-wheel and trackpad gestures navigate terminal history instead of cycling through previously typed commands.
- Disabled tmux pane alternate-screen mode while preserving the persistent session and all three sign-in options.

## 1.1.3

- Corrected the history rail to use ttyd's actual xterm viewport; ttyd 1.7.7 does not expose a `window.term` object.
- Made history-rail initialization retry until ttyd has created its terminal, restoring the visible rail and mouse-wheel history navigation.

## 1.1.2

- Added an always-visible terminal-history rail that reads xterm's full buffer directly, including on Home Assistant's embedded browsers that hide native overlay scrollbars.
- Restored mouse-wheel terminal-history navigation through the rail's xterm buffer handling.

## 1.1.1

- Restored the stable persistent terminal-session identity so existing terminal scrollback and its visible scrollbar remain available after updating.

## 1.1.0

- Restored browser-based ChatGPT sign-in: Codex provides a terminal URL when a browser cannot open automatically.
- Kept Device Code as the preferred sign-in method for Home Assistant's embedded page and retained API-key sign-in as the third option.
- Replaced outdated App Store installation instructions with a My Home Assistant repository link and current Apps terminology.
- Added contribution guidance requiring personally reviewed, human-authored communication for any Open Home Foundation submission.

## 1.0.1

- Minor documentation update.

## 1.0.0

- Released the first official stable version of HA Codex.
- Refreshed the repository introduction and added a Buy Me a Coffee support link at the top of the GitHub README.

## 0.1.29

- Added default-on Patch compatibility mode so Codex's normal `apply_patch` mechanism works on Home Assistant OS, where nested Bubblewrap user namespaces are unavailable.
- Kept normal Codex command-approval behavior unchanged and added a Configuration toggle for troubleshooting.

## 0.1.28

- Made session persistence work with the default inline-history mode, so Codex stays running when you leave the HA Codex sidebar and reattaches when you return.
- Preserved the browser's visible scrollbar and mouse-wheel behavior while using the persistent terminal session.
- Reduced the default terminal scrollback from 10,000 to 5,000 lines; both session persistence and history preservation remain enabled by default.

## 0.1.27

- Promoted Home Assistant control setup to a prominent notice at the top of both README files and the Home Assistant add-on description.

## 0.1.26

- Added opt-in, built-in Home Assistant control actions with no user-managed token, IP address, or host setup.
- Added the restricted `ha-codex-ha` helper for configuration validation, selected reload actions, and a validated Home Assistant Core restart.
- Added separate disabled-by-default controls for Home Assistant actions and Core restart, plus Codex instructions to explain and request approval before using them.

## 0.1.25

- Added a permanently visible, styled native xterm scrollbar for terminal history.
- Removed the unused synthetic history gutter so the terminal keeps its full width.

## 0.1.24

- Removed the tmux display layer from inline-history mode so Codex output reaches xterm's scrollback buffer directly.
- Restored the visible history rail and mouse-wheel scrolling for long Codex responses.
- Keeps fullscreen-mode session persistence through tmux while ttyd owns the inline session for the add-on runtime.

## 0.1.23

- Initializes xterm's history buffer with the configured scrollback size before terminal output arrives.
- Fixed long output being limited to the visible screen despite a larger Terminal scrollback setting.

## 0.1.22

- Applies the configured terminal-history limit to persistent tmux sessions.
- Enables tmux mouse/copy-mode scrolling so wheel and trackpad gestures scroll history instead of recalling shell commands.
- Starts a fresh persistent session so the history and mouse settings take effect after updating.

## 0.1.21

- Made the history rail navigate xterm's full terminal buffer directly instead of the browser viewport.
- Explicitly reapplies the configured terminal scrollback size after the terminal client initializes.

## 0.1.20

- Start a fresh persistent terminal session after the sign-in-menu update so existing sessions do not retain Codex's previous three-choice prompt.

## 0.1.19

- Replaced Codex's three-choice first-run login screen with an HA Codex sign-in menu.
- Made **Sign in with Device Code (Preferred Method)** option 1 and kept API-key sign-in as option 2.

## 0.1.18

- Put model selection first in the Home Assistant Apps description and setup guidance, directing users to App Configuration before starting HA Codex.

## 0.1.17

- Removed the current-browser sign-in path from setup instructions.
- Promoted **Log in with a different device (Preferred Method)** to sign-in option 1 and renumbered the API-key path as option 2.

## 0.1.16

- Replaced wordy Top/End controls with compact, accessible up/down arrows.
- Restored xterm's native wheel, trackpad, and touch history handling so the full configured scrollback range is available.
- Slimmed the history gutter and removed the duplicate native scrollbar to preserve terminal space in the Home Assistant sidebar.

## 0.1.15

- Added an inset terminal-history gutter that never covers terminal text or the status row.
- Added draggable history, Top/End buttons, mouse-wheel and trackpad scrolling, and touch-swipe scrolling.

## 0.1.14

- Fixed the visible terminal scrollbar build path by including the standard text and compression utilities it requires.

## 0.1.13

- Added all currently documented Codex CLI models to the Configuration selector.
- Documented the model choices and clarified the difference between the add-on default and Codex's in-session `/model` command.

## 0.1.12

- Made the recommended **Log in with a different device** sign-in path prominent in both READMEs.

## 0.1.11

- Added an always-visible, touch-draggable terminal scrollbar for reviewing long Codex responses in Home Assistant.
- Kept the browser's native scrollbar available as well, where the device shows it.

## 0.1.10

- Added Preserve terminal history, which starts Codex in inline transcript mode so long reviews can be scrolled in Home Assistant.
- Reduced the default terminal history buffer to 10,000 lines for a better browser-memory balance.
- Documented every add-on setting in the repository and add-on READMEs.

## 0.1.9
