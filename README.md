> ## **HA Codex** — OpenAI Codex for Home Assistant
>
> Work with Codex directly from your Home Assistant sidebar. HA Codex gives it
> focused, read/write access to your configuration so it can review and improve
> YAML, dashboards, automations, scripts, packages, custom components, and
> documentation—while you stay in control of every change.

> [!CAUTION]
> HA Codex can modify your Home Assistant configuration. Make a Home Assistant
> backup and review every proposed diff before approving a change.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## Enable Home Assistant reload and restart actions
>
> In **HA Codex → Configuration**, turn on **Allow Home Assistant control
> actions**, then restart HA Codex. This enables configuration validation and
> supported reload actions. To let Codex restart Home Assistant Core, separately
> enable **Allow Home Assistant Core restart**. Both settings are off by
> default; no token, IP address, or host setup is required.

## HA Codex in use

This real, privacy-safe workspace capture shows Codex reading a Home Assistant
configuration file. It also shows the optional MCP warning discussed below;
normal file access and Codex operation continue as expected.

## What it is — and is not

| HA Codex is | HA Codex is not |
| --- | --- |
| A coding workspace with read/write access to `/config` | A replacement for Home Assistant Assist |
| A way to have Codex inspect and propose edits to your files | An unattended administrator that should make changes without review |
| A Home Assistant add-on with a persistent terminal session | A host-level or Docker management tool |

The add-on intentionally has **no** host networking, Docker socket, full host
access, or Supervisor-management API access. Its optional Home Assistant
control actions use Home Assistant's internal Core API through a small,
allowlisted helper.

## Install

[![Add HA Codex repository to Home Assistant](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fambient-home-systems%2Fha-codex)
[![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/ambient-home-systems/ha-codex?label=version&sort=semver)](https://github.com/ambient-home-systems/ha-codex/releases/latest)

1. Select the button above to open your Home Assistant instance with the HA
   Codex repository URL pre-filled, then add the repository.
2. Open **Settings → Apps → App Store**.
3. Find **HA Codex**, then select **Install** and **Start**.
4. Enable **Show in sidebar**, then open **HA Codex** from the sidebar.

If the button does not open your Home Assistant instance, open the App Store
and use its repository-management option to add:

```text
https://github.com/ambient-home-systems/ha-codex
```

## First-time sign-in

On its first launch, HA Codex shows a two-option sign-in menu. Use a ChatGPT
account that has access to Codex for Device Code sign-in; ChatGPT subscription
access and OpenAI API billing are separate. After updating from an earlier
version, restart HA Codex to begin this revised sign-in flow in a fresh session.

### 1. Log in with a different device (Preferred Method)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Recommended for most Home Assistant installations**
>
> Choose **Log in with a different device**. Codex will display a secure URL
> and one-time code. Open the URL on a phone, tablet, or another computer,
> sign in to your ChatGPT account, enter the code if asked, then return to HA
> Codex.
>
> This is the supported ChatGPT sign-in method for Home Assistant add-ons. A
> browser callback cannot reliably return from your device to Codex inside its
> isolated add-on container. The code is temporary—never share it.

> [!NOTE]
> Device codes are deliberately not shown in public screenshots. Treat the
> temporary URL and code as sign-in credentials and keep them private.

### 2. OpenAI API key (only if your Codex sign-in screen offers it)

An API key is a separate, usage-billed OpenAI Platform account. It does **not**
use your ChatGPT subscription allowance. Prefer Device Code sign-in unless you
specifically want API-billed usage. Never paste an API key in
an issue, screenshot, chat, or repository file.

## Model choice

HA Codex defaults to **GPT-6 Luna** with **xhigh** reasoning effort. If GPT-6
Luna is not available on your account, pick another model. The Configuration
tab offers the following model choices:

| Model | Best use |
| --- | --- |
| **GPT-6 Astra** | The hardest workflows across code, apps, and research. |
| **GPT-6 Sol** | Complex coding and agentic workflows. |
| **GPT-6 Luna** (default) | Focused coding and clear, repeatable work. |
| **GPT-5.6 Terra** | Everyday Home Assistant work; the best balance of quality, speed, and usage. |
| **GPT-5.6 Sol** | Difficult, ambiguous, high-value work that benefits from more analysis and polish. |
| **GPT-5.6 Luna** | Clear, repeatable, or high-volume work where speed and lower usage matter. |
| **GPT-5.6** | The general GPT-5.6 default model alias. |
| **GPT-5.5** | Previous-generation model; retires from Codex with ChatGPT sign-in on October 14, 2026. |
| **GPT-5.3 Codex Spark** | A text-only, real-time coding preview for ChatGPT Pro accounts. |

The Configuration setting starts Codex with `--model` every time the add-on
starts. It is your durable startup preference. In contrast, `/model` inside
Codex changes the model of the active session immediately. After changing the
add-on setting, restart HA Codex; with session persistence on, this also opens
the matching model-specific terminal session. Availability depends on your
account, sign-in method, workspace settings, and rollout. Adding a choice here
does not grant access to it. Check `/model` in an authenticated session for the
choices available to your account, or see the [official Codex model guidance](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/models).
GPT-5.5 remains available through the API after its ChatGPT sign-in retirement;
ChatGPT users should select an available replacement before that date.

## Add-on settings

Open **HA Codex → Configuration** in Home Assistant and select the model you
want before starting HA Codex. Restart the add-on after changing a setting.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Model** | GPT-6 Luna | The starting model for new Codex sessions. |
| **Reasoning effort** | xhigh | How hard Codex thinks before answering: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, or `ultra`. Higher is more thorough but slower and uses more of your plan. `ultra` is available on GPT-6 Astra, GPT-6 Sol, GPT-5.6 Terra, and GPT-5.6 Sol; `max` also on GPT-6 Luna and GPT-5.6 Luna. Other models go up to `xhigh`. A level the selected model does not offer is lowered to its highest one, with a note in the add-on log. `default` uses the model's own setting, or the one you saved in Codex. |
| **Terminal font size** | 14 | Changes the terminal text size (10–24). |
| **Terminal scrollback** | 5,000 lines | Sets how much past terminal output is retained (1,000–50,000 lines) in both the browser and persistent terminal session, including output produced immediately after startup. 5,000 is a practical balance. |
| **Terminal theme** | Dark | Selects the terminal color theme. |
| **Session persistence** | On | Keeps the active Codex session running while you navigate to another Home Assistant page, then reattaches it when you return to the HA Codex sidebar. |
| **Preserve terminal history** | On | Retains the browser's visible scrollbar and long inline transcript while the persistent session runs in the background. This is recommended. |
| **Patch compatibility mode** | On | Lets Codex use its normal patch mechanism on Home Assistant OS, whose nested Bubblewrap restriction would otherwise force a shell-edit fallback. Command approval behavior is unchanged. |
| **Skip command approvals** | Off | "YOLO mode". New Codex sessions run commands and edit files without asking you first, including Home Assistant reloads and restarts when control actions are enabled. Turn it on only if you review Codex's changes afterwards and keep backups. When off, Codex asks as usual. |
| **Codex memories** | Off | Starts new Codex sessions with the Codex memories feature enabled, so Codex can carry useful details between sessions. When off, any choice made with `/memories` in Codex still applies. |
| **Terminal file transfer** | Off | Enables `trz`/`tsz` so you can upload files to the terminal and download them back. Leave it off unless you need it, because it can interfere with pasting long text. |
| **Allow Home Assistant control actions** | Off | Lets Codex validate configuration and request only the supported reload actions through HA Codex's restricted helper. |
| **Allow Home Assistant Core restart** | Off | Lets the helper restart Core only after a successful configuration check. Requires Home Assistant control actions to be enabled. |

### Home Assistant reload and restart actions

HA Codex can optionally validate configuration, reload selected configuration
areas, and restart Home Assistant Core. This works entirely inside Home
Assistant: no IP address, long-lived token, host terminal, Docker access, or
additional installation is required.

To enable it, turn on **Allow Home Assistant control actions** in
**HA Codex → Configuration**, then restart the add-on. To permit Core restarts
as well, explicitly turn on **Allow Home Assistant Core restart**. Both are off
by default. Codex is instructed to show the intended action and ask for command
approval before requesting a reload or restart, unless **Skip command
approvals** is on.

The built-in `ha-codex-ha` helper supports a configuration check; reloads for
automations, scripts, scenes, groups, templates, Core configuration, and
Lovelace resources; and a validated Core restart. It does not provide host,
Docker, Supervisor, update, shutdown, or arbitrary Home Assistant service
control. A dashboard configuration change can still require refreshing the
browser; reloading Lovelace resources does not itself reload a dashboard's YAML
or storage configuration.

### Skip command approvals ("YOLO mode")

A mode chosen with `/approvals` inside Codex only lasts for the running
session. To keep "never ask" across restarts, turn on **Skip command
approvals** in **HA Codex → Configuration** and restart the add-on. Codex then
runs commands and reloads or restarts Home Assistant (if control actions are
enabled) without asking first; the helper still requires a passing
configuration check before a Core restart. Take a backup before using it.

### Long reviews and scrolling

With **Preserve terminal history** on, a long review stays in the normal
terminal transcript so the browser can scroll through it. A visible gold
history rail at the right edge shows your position in the history: use its
up/down buttons, click or drag its track, scroll with a mouse wheel or
trackpad, or swipe inside the terminal on a touch device. The rail navigates
the full configured history buffer even when
Home Assistant hides the browser's native scrollbar. Increase **Terminal
scrollback** only if 5,000 lines is genuinely not enough.

### Patches on Home Assistant OS

Leave **Patch compatibility mode** enabled (the default). Home Assistant OS
blocks the nested unprivileged Bubblewrap namespace that Codex normally uses
for patches, which can otherwise make Codex say that the normal patch mechanism
is unavailable before it edits any file. This mode uses HA Codex's existing
add-on container boundary instead, so normal patches work without host, Docker,
or Supervisor-management access. It does not change Codex's command-approval
behavior. Turn it off only when diagnosing a sandbox-related issue.

## Copy and paste in the terminal

HA Codex runs in a browser terminal, so the clipboard habits from a desktop
terminal app do not all carry over. Two things catch most people:

- **Ctrl+C is not copy.** The terminal sends it to Codex as an interrupt: it
  cancels the current turn, and a second press quits Codex. Copy with the
  shortcuts below instead.
- **Hold a key while you drag to select.** The persistent session runs inside
  tmux, which takes over the mouse so wheel and trackpad scrolling can move
  through history. A plain drag therefore produces a tmux highlight that only
  reaches tmux's internal buffer, not your clipboard. Hold **Shift** (Windows)
  or **Option ⌥** (Mac) while dragging to make a normal browser selection. The
  terminal copies that selection to your clipboard automatically and briefly
  flashes a small ✂ icon to confirm.

### Windows

| Action | How |
| --- | --- |
| Copy | Hold **Shift**, drag across the text, then release. It is copied automatically. **Ctrl+Insert** also copies a selection. |
| Paste | **Ctrl+Shift+V** or **Shift+Insert**. Plain **Ctrl+V** does not paste: the terminal passes it to Codex as a control keystroke. |

The same shortcuts work on Linux and ChromeOS.

### macOS

| Action | How |
| --- | --- |
| Copy | Hold **Option ⌥**, drag across the text, then release. It is copied automatically. **Cmd+C** also copies a selection. |
| Paste | **Cmd+V**. |

### Tips

- A multi-line paste arrives as a single message. Review it at the Codex prompt,
  then press **Enter** to send it.
- To reuse terminal output inside Codex without touching your clipboard, drag
  without holding a key (tmux copies it to its own buffer), then press
  **Ctrl-b** followed by **]** to paste it at the Codex prompt.
- If long pastes arrive garbled, make sure **Terminal file transfer** is off in
  **HA Codex → Configuration**. It routes terminal input through a file-drop
  handler that can interfere with large pastes.
- On Home Assistant's iOS and Android apps and other touch browsers, use the
  standard long-press selection and paste gestures.

## Safe first prompts

Start in review mode:

```text
Review my Home Assistant configuration. Do not make edits. Explain your findings first.
```

Before approving a change:

```text
Show the exact files and diff you propose. Do not restart Home Assistant.
```

For a focused task:

```text
Review automations.yaml for duplicate triggers and risky conditions. Do not change anything yet.
```

## Warnings you may see

### `MCP startup incomplete` or `dataAnalyticsWidgets failed to start`

You may see an MCP warning on startup, such as a `dataAnalyticsWidgets` client
failure. This is an optional Codex plugin/client startup message, not a Home
Assistant or HA Codex failure. If `codex mcp list` reports that no MCP servers
are configured and Codex can read your files, **you can safely ignore it**. It
does not affect normal Codex prompts, terminal commands, or access to your Home
Assistant configuration.

### `[features].memory_tool` is deprecated

Codex renamed this setting to `[features].memories`. HA Codex 1.2.14 and later
renames the old key in its saved Codex configuration when the add-on starts, so
restart the add-on once to clear the warning. To turn memories on from the
add-on, enable **Codex memories** in the Configuration tab.

### Sandbox / Bubblewrap warning

HA Codex 0.1.4 and later includes Bubblewrap. Update the add-on if you see an
older sandbox warning. If it remains after updating, restart the add-on once;
normal Codex operation is not blocked by the fallback sandbox message.

## Updates and releases

Every release has three matching records:

- The add-on version in `home_assistant_codex_app/config.yaml`.
- User-facing Home Assistant update notes in the [changelog](home_assistant_codex_app/CHANGELOG.md).
- A tagged [GitHub Release](https://github.com/ambient-home-systems/ha-codex/releases).

Maintainers publish the release by running the **Publish HA Codex release**
workflow from the Actions tab after the version bump reaches `main`. It tags the
version-bump commit and uses that version's changelog section as the notes.

Codex CLI updates are released automatically. Every 6 hours the **Update
Codex CLI** workflow checks for a newer stable Codex CLI release. When one
exists, it pins that version in `build.yaml`, bumps the add-on's patch version,
adds a changelog entry, and runs the amd64 and aarch64 builds and smoke tests on a
`codex-update/<version>` branch. If the test passes, it fast-forwards `main` and
publishes the release. If the test fails, `main` stays as it is, the branch is
kept for inspection, and the next run tries again. The workflow only changes
the Codex version, so new models still need to be added to the model selector
by hand.

Use the App Store to install updates. Open the update details before
installing to read the changelog.

## Contributing

Please review and understand every proposed change before submitting it. If HA
Codex is ever contributed to an Open Home Foundation project, the contributor
must personally review and own the work and all communication with maintainers;
do not use an autonomous agent to submit issues, pull requests, or responses.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Support and privacy

When asking for help, include the add-on version and the exact error text, but
remove access tokens, device codes, API keys, private URLs, and personal
information. Do not post an entire `configuration.yaml` publicly unless you
have reviewed it for secrets.
